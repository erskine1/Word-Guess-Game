    // Testing area 
    // Picks a random word from an array of words
    // Display a number of underscores corresponding to the number of letters in the word chosen
    // User guesses one letter at a time
    // If they guess a letter in the word, it replaces the corresponding underscore
    // User cannot guess the same letter more than once for a word
    // If user runs out of guesses, they lose, if they guess all the letters they win
      // Display the answer to the user when they lose
    // use arrays for the word list as well as the answer
    // use a for loop to update based on user guesses
